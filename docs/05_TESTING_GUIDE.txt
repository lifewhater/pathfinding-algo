TESTING GUIDE

Minimum tests:
  1) Trivial reachable map (single-row corridor)
  2) Small map with walls and a known shortest path
  3) No-path map (goal isolated by walls)

What to verify:
  - Found yes/no correct
  - Path is continuous with 4-neighbor moves
  - PathLen equals nodes-1; Cost equals PathLen on unit grid
  - Visited mask length equals Width*Height
  - Deterministic outputs for same inputs
