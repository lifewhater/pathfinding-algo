===== ANALYSIS & TRADEOFFS =====

Observations:

1. Path Optimality
   All three algorithms found the same optimal path (cost = 10, length = 11).
   This confirms correctness: BFS and Dijkstra guarantee shortest paths on unit grids,
   and A* with an admissible heuristic (Manhattan distance) also guarantees optimality.

2. Node Exploration
   BFS and Dijkstra explored 40 nodes (identical), as expected on uniform-cost grids.
   A* explored only 28 nodes (30% fewer) by using Manhattan distance heuristic to guide
   the search toward the goal, pruning less-promising branches earlier.

3. Execution Time
   BFS was fastest (6ms), followed by A* (8ms), then Dijkstra (9ms).
   The time differences are negligible for this small grid, but on larger grids:
   - BFS's simple queue operations are cheapest
   - A* heuristic computation + priority queue becomes worth it due to fewer visits
   - Dijkstra lies between due to priority queue but no heuristic benefit

4. When to Use Each Algorithm
   - BFS: Optimal for unweighted/unit-cost grids when simplicity matters
   - Dijkstra: General shortest path; handles variable edge weights; no heuristic needed
   - A*: Best for pathfinding with heuristic info; explores fewer nodes on larger grids

5. Conclusion
   On this small test case, BFS wins on speed due to minimal overhead.
   However, A* demonstrates clear value by visiting 30% fewer nodes with only 33% time increase.
   On larger grids (100x100+), A*'s node savings would more than offset its heuristic cost,
   making it the practical choice for game AI and robotics applications.
