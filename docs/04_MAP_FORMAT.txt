MAP FILE FORMAT

Header lines (order-insensitive; one per line):
  WIDTH  <cols>
  HEIGHT <rows>
  START  <row> <col>
  GOAL   <row> <col>

Grid body:
  Exactly HEIGHT lines, each with WIDTH characters from {'.', '#'}

Rules:
  - START and GOAL coordinates must refer to '.' cells in the body
  - Coordinates are 0-based (row, col)
  - Lines starting with '#' are treated as comments in the header section only
